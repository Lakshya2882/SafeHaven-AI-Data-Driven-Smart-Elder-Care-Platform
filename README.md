## 📊 Key Features
- Explored and cleaned national elder care datasets using **Jupyter Notebook** and **Pandas**
- Built **interactive visualizations** using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Applied **Linear Regression** to predict occupancy growth and revenue trends through 2031
- Created **Power BI dashboards** for workforce planning and funding allocation
- Delivered a business proposal with a three-phase rollout plan and financial forecasting
